MuShop provides an umbrella helm chart called `setup`, which includes several
_recommended_ installations on the cluster. These represent common 3rd party
services, which integrate with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or enable certain
application features.

| [Grafana](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/grafana/README.md) | Infrastructure/service visualization dashboards | `grafana.enabled` |
| [Metrics Server](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/metrics-server/README.md) | Support for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling | `metrics-server.enabled` |
| [Ingress Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) | Ingress controller and public Load Balancer | `ingress-nginx.enabled` |
| [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/blob/master/charts/catalog/README.md) | Service Catalog chart utilized by Oracle Service Broker | `catalog.enabled` |
| [Cert Manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/README.md) | x509 certificate management for Kubernetes | `cert-manager.enabled` |
